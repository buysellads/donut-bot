INSTALLATION

 - Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
 - Create a new donutbot project directory with all of the files from this repository
 - Install node-dirty with npm in your project directory (https://github.com/felixge/node-dirty)
 - Download and extract node-campfire into your node_modules folder in your project directory
   (https://github.com/tristandunn/node-campfire)
 
 - In Campfire, go to the "Users" tab and then follow "People on your site" (you must be an administrator)
 - Add a new person named "Donut Bot", and login to Campfire as this user.
 - Once logged in, click "My Info" in the top-right and then copy the API auth token provided.
 
 - Open up config.js and modify the following configuration settings:
   - exports.campfire to use the account subdomain of your Campfire account, and Donut Bot's API auth token.
   - exports.rooms to include the ID of every room in which you'd like Donut Bot to hangout.
     Note: The room ID is the number at the end of the URL of the given room.
   - exports.users to map Campfire user IDs to the nicknames by which Donut Bot will recognize people.
     Note: User IDs can be found in the reset or delete link on the "People in your Company" page.
   - exports.defaults to specify the number of donuts each user should start with.

 - Run `node bot.js` and you're off to the races! 


NOTES

 - We use nohup (e.g. `nohup node bot.js &`) to run the Donut Bot 24/7 in the background
 - To reset donut totals, stop node.js, delete data.db, and restart the bot.
 - Do not expect real donuts out of this.
